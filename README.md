# SCSS Challenges

The challenges from the Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets module of the course

## Mixin Challenge
Write a mixin called box. It accepts two arguments: size and background-color. The size should be set to width and height should be half of the size. Create a box class that will include that mixin. Pass 200px as a value for the size and #bada55 color for the background-color property. Generate the css file with the same name as your scss file.

## Container Class Challenge
Your task is to generate the following CSS classes: .container-1, .container-2, .container-3, .container-4.

You'll find a link to boilerplate files below to help get you started. There is a list of colors in the challenge2.scss file. Each of those classes should have one of the colors from the list set as a value for the background-color property. Use any of the loops you want!

## Placeholder Challenge
Your challenge is to review a code snippet and improve it. Use the hint tab to access the boilerplate files. Open the file called challenge3.scss.

Is something wrong with this code? How can we improve it? Is something repetitive? Maybe a straightforward placeholder can help us out...

## Selector Challenge
Your challenge is to change the color of all anchor elements that fulfil the following criteria:

The anchor is part of an unordered list
The anchor has a class called listRight
The anchor is a child of an element which has a class called container
The anchor element should change to the color red when a user hovers over it. Use the nesting and the & selector to achieve this effect.

Use the hint tab to access the boilerplate files. The elements you want to target are included in the index.html file.
