# SCSS Challenges

The challenges from the Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets module of the course

Mixin Challenge
Write a mixin called box. It accepts two arguments: size and background-color. The size should be set to width and height should be half of the size. Create a box class that will include that mixin. Pass 200px as a value for the size and #bada55 color for the background-color property. Generate the css file with the same name as your scss file.

Container Class Challenge
Your task is to generate the following CSS classes: .container-1, .container-2, .container-3, .container-4.

You'll find a link to boilerplate files below to help get you started. There is a list of colors in the challenge2.scss file. Each of those classes should have one of the colors from the list set as a value for the background-color property. Use any of the loops you want!
